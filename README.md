The Driver Drowsiness and Obstacle Avoidance with Auto-Controlled Vehicle project aims to 
enhance road safety by combining real-time driver monitoring with intelligent vehicle 
response. Driver fatigue is a major cause of road accidents, and unexpected obstacles 
further increase risk. The system uses an IR eye blink sensor to detect drowsiness and an 
ultrasonic sensor mounted on a servo motor to scan the vehicle’s surroundings. These 
sensors feed data to an Arduino microcontroller, which processes the information and 
controls the vehicle’s movement via an L298N motor driver.
A 16×2 I2C LCD display provides real-time updates on driver alertness and obstacle 
distances. When the driver shows signs of drowsiness, the system triggers a buzzer alert. If 
obstacles are detected, the vehicle can automatically stop or maneuver safely. LED 
indicators are also incorporated to signal turning directions during automatic navigation. 
This integration of sensors, visual and auditory alerts, and motor control ensures both the 
driver’s safety and efective obstacle avoidance
